# User Stories

**User Story 1**  
As someone checking out the site for the first time, I want the navigation to be clear and straightforward so I can quickly find sections like education, experience, or projects.  

**User Story 2**  
As a hiring manager, I want to see project images with short descriptions so I can get a fast idea of the kind of work Jesse has done and the tools involved.  

**User Story 3**  
As a visitor who might want to reach out, I want a simple contact form with the basics (name, email, message) so it’s easy to get in touch.  

**User Story 4**  
As someone viewing the site on my phone, I want the layout to fit well on a small screen so I don’t have to zoom or scroll sideways.
